# CQL (Confluence Query Language)

The Confluence Query Language is used in Confluence to build complex document queries.
The cql family of extensions for XWiki brings support for this query language in XWiki,
which is especially useful to support people who migrated content from Confluence to XWiki
and have used Confluence macros such as contentbylabel which makes use of this language.
